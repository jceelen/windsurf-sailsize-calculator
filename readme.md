#Windsurf Sail Size Calculator
Wouldn't it be nice if you could enter your weight, wind predictions and you get an advice which sails you should bring to the water. 

This script is a very simple first version and a research project and not really meant for distribution (yet) but just try it! And please, [give me feedback!](https://github.com/jceelen/windsurf-sailsize-calculator/issues) :-). I am happy to help with questions.

## TODO ##
- read the csv file
- make script to lookup the right sailsize with a fixed weight and windspeed
- enter windspeed
- save weight
- make interface
- add gusts
- sailingstyle
- sailing level (expert/intermediate)
- learning from past experiences
